# Git üí°

## Introduction to Git
- Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.

- Git is easy to learn and has a tiny footprint with lightning fast performance. It outclasses SCM tools like Subversion, CVS, Perforce, and ClearCase with features like cheap local branching, convenient staging areas, and multiple workflows.

- Git is a version control system for tracking changes in computer files and coordinating work on those files among multiple people.

- Git is a Distributed Version Control System. So Git does not necessarily rely on a central server to store all the versions of a project‚Äôs files. Instead, every developer ‚Äúclones‚Äù a copy of a repository (a collection of files) and has the full history of the project on their own hard drive. This copy (or ‚Äúclone‚Äù) has all of the metadata of the original.

- Git is a software that helps you track changes made to files. As you edit these files, you tell Git to add the changes you made. When you‚Äôre ready, you ‚Äúcommit‚Äù the changes, which records them in your repository. You can then ‚Äúpush‚Äù your changes to a remote repository, or ‚Äúpull‚Äù changes others have made to your local copy.
