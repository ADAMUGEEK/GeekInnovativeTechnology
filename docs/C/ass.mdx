## Algorithm:
- Get User Input:
Display a prompt asking the user to enter the first number.
Read the user input and store it in the variable num1.
Display a prompt asking the user to enter an operator (+, -, *, /).
Read the user input and store it in the variable operator with a space before %c to consume any whitespace characters.
Display a prompt asking the user to enter the second number.
Read the user input and store it in the variable num2.

- Perform Arithmetic Operations:
Use a switch statement to check the entered operator and perform the corresponding arithmetic operation.
For addition (+), add num1 and num2.
For subtraction (-), subtract num2 from num1.
For multiplication (*), multiply num1 and num2.
For division (/), check if num2 is not zero, then divide num1 by num2.
If num2 is zero, display an error message, and exit the program with an error code.
For an invalid operator, display an error message, and exit the program with an error code.
Store the result in the variable result.

- Display Result:
Display the result of the arithmetic operation with two decimal places.

- Exit Successfully:
Return 0 to indicate successful program execution.

## Program Flow
- User Interaction
User is prompted to enter the first number.
User enters the first number.
User is prompted to enter an operator (+, -, *, /).
User enters the operator.
User is prompted to enter the second number.
User enters the second number.

- Arithmetic Operations:
The program uses a switch statement to identify the operator and perform the corresponding arithmetic operation.
If the operator is invalid or division by zero is attempted, an error message is displayed, and the program exits with an error code.
Otherwise, the result of the arithmetic operation is calculated and stored in the variable result.

- Display Result:
The program displays the result of the arithmetic operation with two decimal places.

- Exit Successfully:
The program exits with a return code of 0, indicating successful execution.
This program allows the user to perform basic arithmetic operations on two numbers based on user input. It includes error checking for invalid operators and division by zero.

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    double num1, num2, result;
    char operator;

    // Get user input
    printf("Enter first number: ");
    scanf("%lf", &num1);

    printf("Enter operator (+, -, *, /): ");
    scanf(" %c", &operator);  // Note the space before %c to consume any whitespace characters

    printf("Enter second number: ");
    scanf("%lf", &num2);

    // Perform arithmetic operations
    switch (operator) {
        case '+':
            result = num1 + num2;
            break;
        case '-':
            result = num1 - num2;
            break;
        case '*':
            result = num1 * num2;
            break;
        case '/':
            if (num2 != 0) {
                result = num1 / num2;
            } else {
                printf("Error: Division by zero is not allowed.\n");
                return 1;  // Exit with an error code
            }
            break;
        default:
            printf("Error: Invalid operator.\n");
            return 1;  // Exit with an error code
    }

    // Display the result
    printf("Result: %.2lf %c %.2lf = %.2lf\n", num1, operator, num2, result);

    return 0;  // Exit successfully
}

```

## Algorithm

- step 1 Prompt User for Number of Courses:
Display a prompt asking the user to enter the number of courses.
Read the user input and store it in the variable numCourses.

- step 2 Validate Number of Courses:
Check if numCourses is less than or equal to 0.
If true, display an error message and exit the program with an error code.

- step 3 Initialize Variables:
Initialize totalCredits and totalGradePoints to 0.0.

- step 4  Loop for Each Course:
Use a for loop to iterate from 1 to numCourses.

- step 5 Inside the loop:
Display a prompt for course details (course number).
Read and store user input for course credits in the variable credits.
Read and store user input for course grade in the variable grade.

- step 6 Validate Grade:
Check if grade is outside the valid range of 0 to 4 (on a 4.0 scale).
If true, display an error message and exit the program with an error code.

- step 7 Update Total Credits and Grade Points:
Add credits to totalCredits.
Add the product of credits and grade to totalGradePoints.

- step 10 Exit Successfully:
Return 0 to indicate successful program execution.

## Program Flow:

- User Interaction:
User is prompted to enter the number of courses.
User enters the number of courses.

- Validation:
The program checks if the entered number of courses is valid (greater than 0).
If not, an error message is displayed, and the program exits with an error code.

- Initialization:
Variables totalCredits and totalGradePoints are initialized to 0.0.

- Loop for Each Course:
The program enters a loop to gather information for each course.

- User Interaction for Each Course:
User is prompted to enter credits for the current course.
User enters credits for the current course.
User is prompted to enter the grade for the current course.
User enters the grade for the current course.

- Grade Validation:
The program checks if the entered grade is within the valid range (0 to 4).
If not, an error message is displayed, and the program exits with an error code.

- Update Total Credits and Grade Points:
The program updates the cumulative total credits and grade points for all courses.

- Calculate GPA:
The program calculates the GPA based on the accumulated total credits and grade points.
