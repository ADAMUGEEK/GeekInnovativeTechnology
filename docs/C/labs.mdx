# The lab tasks 

outlined in the COSC 206 Introduction to C programming Lab Manual cover a range of fundamental concepts and programming exercises. Here are the main lab tasks mentioned in the manual:

## Lab 1:
- Introduce the basic structure of a C program and the printf function
- Write a simple "Hello, World!" program
- Compile and run the program

## Lab 2:
- Introduce the concept of variables and basic data types
- Declare and use variables
- Input from the user using "scanf"
- Write a program to calculate and display the volume of a cube

## Lab 3:
- Familiarize with different data types, operators, and expressions in C
- Write a program to take input of name, roll number, and marks obtained by a student in 5 subjects and display the percentage score secured

## Lab 4:
- Understand programming knowledge using decision statements (if, if-else, if-else if, switch)
- Write a program to input marks of 5 subjects for a student, display the rank of each subject, and the result of total marks and percentage obtained with the rank in the class

## Lab 5:
- Understand programming using loop statements (for, while, do-while)
- Write a program to input two integer numbers and display the sum of even numbers between these two input numbers

These lab tasks are designed to provide hands-on experience with C programming concepts and problem-solving techniques.
