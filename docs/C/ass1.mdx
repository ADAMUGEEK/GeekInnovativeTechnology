# Algorithm

1. Get User Input:
    - Display a prompt asking the user to enter the number of courses.
    - Read the user input and store it in the variable numCourses.

2. Validate Number of Courses:

    - Check if numCourses is less than or equal to 0.
    - If true, display an error message and exit the program with an error code.

3. Initialize Variables:
    - Initialize totalCredits and totalGradePoints to 0.0.
        - Loop for Each Course:
            - Use a for loop to iterate from 1 to numCourses.
            - Inside the loop:
                - Display a prompt for course details (course number).
                - Read and store user input for course credits in the variable credits.
                - Read and store user input for course grade in the variable grade.

4. Validate Grade:

    - Check if grade is outside the valid range of 0 to 100.
    - If true, display an error message and exit the program with an error code.

5. Calculate Grade Points:
    - Call the calculateGradePoints function, passing the entered grade.
    - Store the result in the variable gradePoints.

6. Update Total Credits and Grade Points:
    - Add credits to totalCredits.
    - Add the product of credits and gradePoints to totalGradePoints.

7. Calculate GPA:
    - Calculate the GPA by dividing totalGradePoints by totalCredits. Store the result in the variable gpa.

8. Display GPA:
    - Display the calculated GPA with two decimal places.

10. Exit Successfully:
    - Return 0 to indicate successful program execution.

```C
#include <stdio.h>

double calculateGradePoints(double grade) {
    if (grade >= 70) {
        return 5.0;
    } else if (grade >= 60) {
        return 4.0;
    } else if (grade >= 50) {
        return 3.0;
    } else if (grade >= 45) {
        return 2.0;
    } else if (grade >= 40) {
        return 1.0;
    } else {
        return 0.0;
    }
}

    int numCourses;
    printf("Enter the number of courses: ");
    scanf("%d", &numCourses);

    // Ensure a valid number of courses is entered
    if (numCourses <= 0) {
        printf("Error: Please enter a valid number of courses.\n");
        return 1;  // Exit with an error code
    }

    double totalCredits = 0.0;
    double totalGradePoints = 0.0;

    for (int i = 1; i <= numCourses; ++i) {
        double credits, grade;
        printf("\nEnter details for Course %d:\n", i);

        // Get user input for course credits
        printf("Enter credits for Course %d: ", i);
        scanf("%lf", &credits);

        // Get user input for course grade
        printf("Enter grade for Course %d: ", i);
        scanf("%lf", &grade);

        // Validate the grade entered
        if (grade < 0 || grade > 100) {
            printf("Error: Please enter a valid grade between 0 and 100.\n");
            return 1;  // Exit with an error code
        }

        // Calculate grade points based on the provided scale
        double gradePoints = calculateGradePoints(grade);

        // Update total credits and grade points
        totalCredits += credits;
        totalGradePoints += credits * gradePoints;
    }

    // Calculate GPA
    double gpa = totalGradePoints / totalCredits;

    // Display the GPA
    printf("\nYour GPA is: %.2lf\n", gpa);

    return 0;  // Exit successfully
}
