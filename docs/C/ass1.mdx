## Algorithm

- step 1 Prompt User for Number of Courses:
Display a prompt asking the user to enter the number of courses.
Read the user input and store it in the variable numCourses.

- step 2 Validate Number of Courses:

Check if numCourses is less than or equal to 0.

If true, display an error message and exit the program with an error code.

- step 3 Initialize Variables:
Initialize totalCredits and totalGradePoints to 0.0.

- step 4  Loop for Each Course:
Use a for loop to iterate from 1 to numCourses.

- step 5 Inside the loop:

Display a prompt for course details (course number).
Read and store user input for course credits in the variable credits.
Read and store user input for course grade in the variable grade.

- step 6 Validate Grade:
Check if grade is outside the valid range of 0 to 4 (on a 4.0 scale).
If true, display an error message and exit the program with an error code.

- step 7 Update Total Credits and Grade Points:
Add credits to totalCredits.
Add the product of credits and grade to totalGradePoints.

- step 8  Calculate GPA:
Calculate the GPA by dividing totalGradePoints by totalCredits. Store the result in the variable gpa.

- step 9 Display GPA:
Display the calculated GPA with two decimal places.

- step 10 Exit Successfully:
Return 0 to indicate successful program execution.

## Program Flow:

- User Interaction:
User is prompted to enter the number of courses.
User enters the number of courses.

- Validation:
The program checks if the entered number of courses is valid (greater than 0).
If not, an error message is displayed, and the program exits with an error code.

- Initialization:
Variables totalCredits and totalGradePoints are initialized to 0.0.

- Loop for Each Course:
The program enters a loop to gather information for each course.

- User Interaction for Each Course:
User is prompted to enter credits for the current course.
User enters credits for the current course.
User is prompted to enter the grade for the current course.
User enters the grade for the current course.

- Grade Validation:
The program checks if the entered grade is within the valid range (0 to 4).

If not, an error message is displayed, and the program exits with an error code.

- Update Total Credits and Grade Points:
The program updates the cumulative total credits and grade points for all courses.

- Calculate GPA:
The program calculates the GPA based on the accumulated total credits and grade points.

- Display GPA:
The program displays the calculated GPA.

- Exit Successfully:
The program exits with a return code of 0, indicating successful execution.

This program allows a user to input information for multiple courses and calculates the GPA based on the entered data.
