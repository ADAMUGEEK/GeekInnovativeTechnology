My name is [ADAMU MUHAMMAD MUHAMMAD](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adamu-muhammad-muhammad-13456b190/), and I'm a computer science and software engineering student at [Gombe State University](https://gsu.edu.ng/home/) and [Alx](https://www.alxafrica.com/) respectively. I'm also the founder and community lead at [Open Source Learners](https://github.com/open-source-learners), a community dedicated to promoting open source education and collaboration.

My journey to tech hasn't been a straightforward one. I didn't grow up coding, but I became increasingly interested in technology and its potential to solve problems and make a positive impact in the world. Along the way, I discovered the importance of open source. Open source software is freely available for anyone to use, modify, and distribute. It's a powerful tool for innovation and collaboration and an essential part of the tech ecosystem.

That's why I'm passionate about sharing the importance of open source with students in tech. I believe that open source is not only a key driver of innovation and progress but also a way to democratize access to technology and empower people to create solutions that make a difference.

On this site, I'll be sharing my journey to tech, including the challenges and opportunities that I've faced along the way. I'll also be highlighting the importance of open source and how it can benefit students in tech, whether they're just starting out or looking to take their skills to the next level.

Here are just a few of the things you can expect to find on my site:

- Personal stories and insights from my journey to tech, including how I discovered my passion for technology and overcame obstacles along the way.

- Practical tips and advice for students in tech, including how to learn programming, how to get involved in open source projects, and how to build a strong professional network.

- In-depth articles and resources on the importance of open source, including how it works, why it matters, and how it's transforming the tech industry.

- Inspiring stories of students and professionals who are making a difference in tech through open source, including their experiences, challenges, and successes.


Whether you're a student who is just starting out in tech or an experienced developer who wants to give back to the community, this site is for you. 
Together, we can build a better, more open, and more inclusive tech ecosystem.
